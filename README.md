# Module 10 Challenge

---
## Mission to Mars
---

### Project Overview
Robin, a junior data scientist who does freelance astronomy work in her free time, aspires to work for NASA. She spends a lot of time online reading about space exploration and NASA's mission to Mars, and decides to develop a web app that scrapes the internet for the information about Mars that she is interested in and shares it with other Red planet enthusiasts.


### Challenge Objectives
Continue to polish the web app constructed up until this point in the module by using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape images of the 4 martian hemispheres from a website, store them in the Mongo database, and display them via the web application. Add more design customization to the web app to make it stand out.
    - Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a web browser and scrape high-resolution images.   
    - Use a MongoDB database to store data from the web scrape.
    - Update the web application and Flask to display the data from the web scrape.
    - Use Bootstrap to style the web app.

**Software**

### Challenge Summary
Some of the customizations I added to the web app design include:
- a red planet red web scraping button that is larger and more pronounced
- bold text for headers and uniform header sizing
- larger and round images of the hemispheres, so web app users can see the planet as though they were looking through a telescope at the night sky
